# PRODUCERS AVENUE - TECHNICAL STACK

## Architecture Overview

Producers Avenue uses a modern, scalable architecture built on proven technologies. The frontend is a static Next.js application hosted on Hostinger, while all backend functionality is managed by Supabase. Large media files are stored and delivered via Bunny.net CDN for optimal performance and cost efficiency.

  },
  trailingSlash: true,
}
```

```

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Security
- Environment variables properly scoped (NEXT_PUBLIC_ only for public)
- XSS protection via React's built-in escaping
- Content Security Policy headers
- HTTPS everywhere
- No sensitive data in localStorage

### Backend Security (Supabase)

- Lazy loading components
- Image optimization (future with Vercel)
- Minimal JavaScript bundle
- CDN for static assets

### Backend
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Connection pooling via Supabase
- Edge Functions for low latency
- Caching strategies (future)

### Media
- Bunny CDN for fast global delivery
- Adaptive bitrate streaming (future)
- Image compression
- Video transcoding (future)

## Scalability Plan

### Current Capacity
- Supabase Pro: Handles thousands of users
- Hostinger: Serves static files efficiently
- Bunny.net: Unlimited bandwidth scaling
- Stripe: Handles millions of transactions

### Scaling Path
1. **0-1,000 users:** Current setup sufficient
2. **1,000-10,000 users:** Upgrade Supabase to Team plan
3. **10,000-100,000 users:** Migrate to Vercel, optimize database
4. **100,000+ users:** Consider dedicated infrastructure, database sharding

### Database Scaling
- Read replicas for heavy queries
- Partitioning large tables
- Archive old data
- Query optimization

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Uptime Monitoring
- UptimeRobot or similar
- Alert on downtime
- Status page for users

### Error Tracking
- Sentry for frontend errors
- Supabase logs for backend
- Slack/email alerts

### Performance Monitoring
- Lighthouse scores
- Core Web Vitals
- API response times
- Database query performance

### Backups
- Supabase automatic daily backups
- Point-in-time recovery
- Manual exports for critical data

## Cost Estimates

### Monthly Costs (Estimated)

**Small Scale (0-1,000 users):**
- Supabase Pro: $25/mo
- Bunny.net: ~$5-10/mo
- Stripe fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Resend: $10/mo (10k emails)
- PostHog: Free tier
- **Total:** ~$40-50/mo + transaction fees

**Medium Scale (1,000-10,000 users):**
- Supabase Team: $599/mo
- Bunny.net: ~$50-100/mo
- Stripe fees: Negotiated rates
- Resend: ~$50/mo
- PostHog: ~$50/mo
- **Total:** ~$750-900/mo + transaction fees

**Large Scale (10,000+ users):**
- Custom pricing and infrastructure
- Dedicated support contracts
- Enterprise features

## Technical Debt & Future Considerations

### Known Limitations
- Static export means no SSR (acceptable tradeoff)
- Manual deployment to Hostinger (automated later)
- No image optimization (add when migrate to Vercel)

### Future Enhancements
- Mobile app (React Native)
- GraphQL API for third parties
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- AI-powered features (recommendations, search)
- Video streaming optimization
- Internationalization (i18n)

## Matching & Search

### How Categories/Skills Affect Matching

**Collab Matcher:**

- Example: Producers matched with vocalists, guitarists with drummers
- Genre overlap increases match score
- Experience level considered (prevent mismatches)

**Search:**
- Users can filter by any category, skill, or genre
- Multi-select filters (AND/OR logic)
- Search by keyword matches categories and skills
- Auto-suggest skills as user types

**Recommendations:**
- Platform suggests collaborators based on:
  - Skills needed for user's work
  - Genre overlap
  - Location proximity (optional)
  - Experience level compatibility
  - Activity level

---

## Admin Approval for "Other" Fields

When a user enters a custom skill/genre/category:

1. Submission stored as "pending approval"
2. Admin notification sent
3. Admin reviews:
   - Is it legitimate?
   - Does it fit existing categories?
   - Is it duplicative?
4. Admin approves or denies (with reason)
5. If approved:
   - Added to user's profile
   - Optionally added to master list for all users
6. User notified of decision

This prevents spam while allowing legitimate new skills/genres to be added.
