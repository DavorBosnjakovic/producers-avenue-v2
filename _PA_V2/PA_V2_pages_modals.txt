## 🎯 KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### **Homepage Structure**

- Three animated cards: Community (left, 0s), Marketplace (bottom, 0.5s delay), Tools (right, 1s delay)
- Cards fade to 50% opacity after slide, text fades in
- Featured sections: Trending, Creators, New Releases, Top Services, Upcoming Webinars

### **Navigation System**
- **Header** (global): Logo, Search icon, Theme toggle, Notifications bell (auth), Avatar dropdown
- **Sidebar** (auth only): Slides out on hover (desktop), hamburger menu (mobile)

- **Bottom Nav** (mobile auth): Feed, Explore, +Post, Notifications, Profile
- **Guest avatar**: Single "Sign Up/Log In" dropdown item
- **Logged avatar**: Duplicates sidebar items in dropdown

### **Search Strategy**
- Search icon opens modal (blur background, live results)
- Press Enter or "View All" → `/search?q=[query]&tab=[tab]`
- One universal search results page with tabs
- Tabs use same templates as browse pages
- Default tab based on where user searched from

### **Profile System**
- Single Smart Link field (rolink.me only) - validated
- Profile tabs: About | Posts | Products | Services
- "View All My Links" button opens rolink.me in new tab
- Hybrid following: One-way = "Following/Followers", Mutual = "Connected" badge

### **Marketplace Structure**
- Unified marketplace with tabs: Products | Services | Webinars
- Same card templates used in search results, profiles, everywhere
- List/Grid toggle on all browse pages
- Advanced filters per category

### **Creation Flows**
- Posts = Modal (quick, stays on page)

- Auto-save drafts every 30 seconds

### **Orders & Payments**

- Real-time status updates (Supabase Realtime)
- Stripe Checkout modal for payments
- Commission snapshot at purchase time

### **Registration Flow (Multi-Step)**
1. Account basics (email, password, username, location)
2. Roles & skills (checkboxes with expansion like image uploaded)
3. Genres & experience level
All in modal, progress bar at top

### **Theme System**
- Sun/Moon toggle in header
- User choice (not auto-detect)
- Saves to preferences
- Smooth 0.3s transition

### **Mobile Strategy**
- Bottom nav for primary actions
- Hamburger menu for secondary
- Sidebar becomes full-screen overlay
