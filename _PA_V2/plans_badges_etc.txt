## 4. PLAN FEATURES EXPLAINED (For Pricing Page)

### Products & Services
Digital products include sample packs, loop packs, presets, templates, and other downloadable content you create. Services are professional offerings like mixing, mastering, production, and consultation sessions. Each plan tier determines how many products and services you can list simultaneously on the marketplace.

### Featured Products/Services
Featured listings receive premium placement on the homepage, category pages, and search results, significantly increasing visibility and potential sales. Standard tier features last 1 week each. You can rotate which products/services are featured at any time through your dashboard.

### Total File Storage
This is your cumulative storage limit across all uploaded products, including audio files, presets, project files, and deliverables. Files are stored on our high-speed CDN for fast global delivery. Additional storage is available if needed.

### Commission Structure
Our commission is calculated on each sale and covers payment processing, platform maintenance, CDN delivery, and customer support. The commission rate is locked in at the time of purchase, so upgrading your plan immediately reduces fees on future sales. All commissions are transparently displayed before checkout.

Think of it as free marketing for your best work—no feedback provided, just powerful promotional exposure when selected.
