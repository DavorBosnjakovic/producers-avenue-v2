# PRODUCERS AVENUE V2 - PAYMENT SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION
**Version:** 2.0 | **Date:** November 6, 2025 | **Status:** ✅ Final

---

## PAYMENT ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

Producers Avenue uses a dual payment system:
- **Stripe Connect (Destination Charges)** - For card payments
- **PayPal Payouts** - For PayPal payments

Both systems use escrow periods to protect buyers and sellers, with fully automated payouts after release.

---

## 1. STRIPE CONNECT (DESTINATION CHARGES)

### How It Works

**Seller Onboarding:**
1. Seller clicks "Connect Stripe Account"
2. Redirected to Stripe Connect onboarding
3. Stripe verifies:
   - Identity (government ID)
   - Bank account
   - Address
   - Business details (if applicable)
4. Once verified, seller can accept card payments
5. We store their `stripe_account_id`

**Payment Flow:**
```
Buyer pays $100 (credit card)
↓
Money goes to PLATFORM Stripe account
↓
Held in escrow (see escrow rules below)
↓
After escrow period ends
↓
Auto-transferred to seller's Stripe Connect account
↓
Seller withdraws to their bank account anytime
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Stripe handles all KYC (Know Your Customer) verification
- ✅ We don't manually verify sellers
- ✅ Stripe Connect account = verified identity + bank account
- ✅ Late chargebacks: Stripe reverses transfer from seller's account
- ✅ If seller has insufficient funds, Stripe handles collection (not us)

### Commission Structure

**Commission deducted as "Application Fee":**
```javascript
// Buyer pays $100
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 10000, // $100.00
  currency: 'usd',
  
  // Transfer to seller after escrow
  transfer_data: {
    destination: seller_stripe_account_id,
  },
  
  // Our commission (30% example)
  application_fee_amount: 3000, // $30.00
});

// Seller receives: $70.00 (after $30 commission)
// Stripe processing fee (~2.9% + $0.30) paid by seller
// Seller net: ~$67.50
```

**Commission Rates by Tier:**
- Basic: 40%
- Standard: 30%
- Premium: 20%
- Ultimate: 10%

---

## 2. PAYPAL SYSTEM

### How It Works

**Seller Setup:**
1. Seller adds their PayPal email in Wallet Settings
2. Optional: We send $0.01 test payment to verify
3. Seller confirms email is correct
4. Can now accept PayPal payments

**Payment Flow:**
```
Buyer pays $100 (PayPal)
↓
Money goes to PLATFORM PayPal account
↓
Held in escrow (see escrow rules below)
↓
After escrow period ends
↓
Platform sends payout to seller's PayPal email
↓
Money arrives instantly in seller's PayPal account
```

**Commission:**
- Deducted before payout
- Same rates as Stripe (40%, 30%, 20%, 10%)
- PayPal processing fee (~2.9% + $0.30) paid by seller

---

## 3. ESCROW RULES

### Products (Digital Downloads)

**Escrow Period: 7 DAYS (Fixed)**

```
Purchase Date → Day 1
Download link sent automatically
↓
7 days pass (buyer can report issues)
↓
Day 8: Money auto-released to seller's available balance
↓
Seller can request payout immediately
```

**Why 7 Days:**
- Buyer has time to download and test files
- Buyer can report if files are corrupted/broken
- Buyer can file DMCA if copyrighted content
- Catches 95%+ of disputes before payout

**Auto-Release:**
- No action needed from buyer
- No action needed from seller
- Automatic after 7 days
- Funds move from "Pending" to "Available"

---

### Services (Freelance Work)

**Escrow Period: UNTIL BUYER CONFIRMS DELIVERY (Max 7 Days)**

```
Service Purchased (Order Created)
↓
Seller marks as "Delivered" + uploads files
↓
Buyer receives notification
↓
OPTION 1: Buyer clicks "Accept Delivery"
  → Money released IMMEDIATELY to seller
↓
OPTION 2: Buyer does nothing
  → After 7 days, money auto-released
↓
OPTION 3: Buyer clicks "Request Revision"
  → Escrow continues, seller must revise
  → Process repeats
```

**Revision Handling:**
```
1. Seller delivers work
2. Buyer requests revision (if within included revisions)
3. Escrow continues
4. Seller submits revised work
5. Buyer accepts OR 7 days pass → Release
```

**Maximum Escrow Time:**
- **7 days from delivery** (not from purchase)
- If buyer doesn't respond in 7 days = Auto-accept
- Prevents buyers from holding money indefinitely

**Example Timeline:**
```
Day 1: Service purchased
Day 5: Seller delivers work
Day 5: Escrow starts counting (7 days from delivery)
Day 7: Buyer requests revision
Day 10: Seller delivers revision
Day 10: Escrow resets (7 days from new delivery)
Day 17: Buyer accepts OR auto-accept
Day 17: Money released to seller
```

---

## 4. WALLET SYSTEM

### Dual Balance Tracking

**Each seller has TWO separate balances:**

```
STRIPE BALANCE:
├─ Pending: $200.00 (from recent card payments)
└─ Available: $450.00 (ready to withdraw)

PAYPAL BALANCE:
├─ Pending: $150.00 (from recent PayPal payments)
└─ Available: $300.00 (ready to withdraw)

TOTAL BALANCE: $1,100.00
├─ Total Pending: $350.00
└─ Total Available: $750.00
```

### Why Separate Balances?

**Keeps money in original payment system:**
- Card payment → Stripe balance → Bank via Stripe Connect
- PayPal payment → PayPal balance → PayPal account

**Benefits:**
- No conversion fees
- Faster payouts
- Simpler accounting
- Lower costs

---

## 5. PAYOUT SYSTEM

### Automatic Payouts (NO Manual Approval)

**Requirements to Request Payout:**
1. ✅ Available balance ≥ $50 (per payment method)
2. ✅ Payout account connected (Stripe or PayPal)
3. ✅ No active disputes or DMCA claims
4. ✅ Account not banned

**Process:**
```
1. Seller clicks "Request Payout"
2. Selects amount (min $50, max available balance)
3. Confirms payment method (Stripe or PayPal)
4. System validates requirements
5. Payout IMMEDIATELY PROCESSED (no admin approval)
6. Status: "Processing"
7. Notification sent to seller
```

**NO ADMIN APPROVAL NEEDED!** Fully automated.

---

### Payout Processing Times

**Stripe:**
```
Request payout
↓
Immediately processed by system
↓
Transfer created to seller's Stripe Connect account (instant)
↓
Seller's Stripe account → Bank account: 2-3 business days
↓
Total time: 2-3 business days
```

**PayPal:**
```
Request payout
↓
Immediately processed by system
↓
PayPal payout sent via PayPal Payouts API
↓
Arrives in seller's PayPal account: INSTANT
↓
Total time: Instant to few hours
```

---

### Payout Fees

**Stripe: FREE**
- No payout fees
- Transfer to Stripe Connect: FREE
- Stripe Connect to bank: FREE

**PayPal: FREE**
- Platform → Seller's PayPal: FREE
- Standard PayPal payout

**Total Cost to Seller: $0**

---

### Minimum Payout

**$50 per payment method**

**Why?**
- Reduces transaction overhead
- Industry standard
- Covers processing costs

**Example:**
- Stripe available: $45 → Can't withdraw yet
- PayPal available: $75 → Can withdraw PayPal only
- Stripe available: $60 → Can now withdraw Stripe too

---

## 6. COMMISSION CALCULATION

### Deducted BEFORE Wallet

**Commission is taken from gross sale, not from payout:**

```
Example: $100 Product Sale (Standard Plan - 30% commission)

Buyer pays: $100.00
↓
Payment processing fee: $3.20 (2.9% + $0.30) - paid by seller
Platform commission: $30.00 (30%) - paid by seller
↓
Amount to seller's wallet: $66.80

After 7 days escrow:
Moves to Available: $66.80

Seller withdraws:
Receives in bank/PayPal: $66.80
```

**Commission Stored in Transaction:**
- Snapshot of seller's tier at time of sale
- Cannot be changed retroactively
- Upgrading plan only affects FUTURE sales

---

## 7. CHARGEBACK HANDLING

### During Escrow Period (0-7 Days)

**Easy handling:**
```
Chargeback filed within escrow
↓
Stripe/PayPal notifies platform
↓
Money still in platform account
↓
Refund processed, seller's pending balance reduced
↓
No loss to platform or seller
```

---

### After Payout (8+ Days)

**Stripe Connect:**
```
Chargeback filed after payout
↓
Stripe notifies platform
↓
Stripe REVERSES transfer from seller's Stripe account
↓
Seller's Stripe balance goes negative if insufficient
↓
Stripe handles collection from seller (not us!)
↓
Platform protected ✅
```

**PayPal:**
```
Chargeback filed after payout
↓
PayPal notifies platform
↓
Platform attempts to deduct from seller's wallet
↓
IF sufficient balance:
  → Deducted, platform protected ✅
↓
IF insufficient balance:
  → Create seller debt
  → Freeze account until debt paid
  → Future earnings pay debt first
  → If seller never returns: Platform eats loss
```

## 16. EDGE CASES & SOLUTIONS

### Seller Account Closed Before Payout

**Scenario:** Seller closes account with pending balance

**Solution:**
```
1. Account closure prevented if balance > $0
2. Must withdraw all funds first
3. OR wait for admin to manually refund buyers
```

---

### Buyer Downloads Then Disputes

**Scenario:** Buyer downloads product, then files chargeback

**Solution:**
```
1. During escrow: Money still held, refund processed
2. After escrow: Chargeback handled by Stripe/PayPal
   - Stripe: Reversed from seller
   - PayPal: Deducted from wallet or debt created
3. Log download timestamp as evidence
```

---

### Seller Never Delivers Service

**Scenario:** Seller takes money, never delivers

**Solution:**
```
1. Buyer waits delivery_days
2. Buyer opens dispute: "Seller not delivering"
3. Platform investigates
4. If seller hasn't responded: Auto-refund
5. Money still in escrow, easy refund
6. Seller account suspended
```

---

### Mass Chargeback Attack

**Scenario:** Bad actor creates fake accounts, files many chargebacks

**Solution:**
```
1. Stripe/PayPal detect fraud patterns
2. Chargebacks reversed if fraudulent
3. Platform monitor chargeback rates per seller
4. Threshold: >2% = investigation
5. Repeated offenders: Account termination
```

---
